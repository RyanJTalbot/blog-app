gatsby-config.js
Tip: There are a variety of remark plugins that you can use to add extra features to your Markdown. You can configure them using the gatsbyRemarkPlugins option when you configure gatsby-plugin-mdx in your gatsby-config.js file.

Here are some popular remark plugins:

    gatsby-remark-images: Use this if you want to generate responsive images when using the Markdown image syntax (which looks like this: ![alt](image url)).
        To use this plugin, youâ€™ll also need gatsby-plugin-sharp, which you installed already in Part 3.
    gatsby-remark-prismjs: Add syntax highlighting to your code blocks.
    gatsby-remark-autolink-headers: Automatically create links for all the headers in your Markdown content.

Try searching for gatsby-remark- in the Gatsby Plugin Library for a full list.
